Having created this personal/portfolio site over the Christmas vacation in 2022 I started off 2023 trying my hand at some framework-less website building. The primary result was sheetxc which I built to display cross country results.    


This project hit the ground running as I already had the data (from previous attempts to explore relationships between finishing place in different races) and I was copying a visual design (from the website Power of 10). This turned out to be a great help as working in a new language really slows ones progress! In the end I built something I'm proud of, the website works (and I can share it with my friends), is easy to maintain, and has (some) testing and linting. When cross country season finished I let the project lie for a little while, but I've since discovered that I can host my database for free on Vercel (rather than having it committed to source code) I'm going to work on that at which point the source code will be ready for release. Recent developments within the UK athletics scene also means that there isn't a single source of truth for cross country results which makes sheetxc both more useful and marginally more annoying to maintain.
