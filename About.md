A data and software enthusiast with a statistical lean Phillip currently splits his time between his PhD thesis corrections and working with world leading biostatisticans at the MRC Biostatistics unit. He has hands on experience deploying machine learning models against vast datasets as well designing field leading Python software. His hobby projects tend to focus on sport and meta-sport - he's currently building a website to make parsing national cross country results easier. While you wait for him to finish that please enjoy a nice figure from his working life as well as the obligatory picture of his face.
