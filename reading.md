Things that I have read (or occasionally watched) and enjoyed, grouped by topic and sorted by complexity.

### Statistics and Machine Learning

[A/B Testing with Fat Tails](https://eduardomazevedo.github.io/papers/azevedo-et-al-ab.pdf)

This makes the list less for its technical content and more because it opened my eyes to how difficult it is to 'guess' which innovations will perform well.

[Flexible Imputation of Missing Data](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-MCAR.html)

Once you've worked in biostatistics for a while you start to get very suspicious of Bookdown websites. They look incredible, but the barrier to entry is low enough that often the content's quality doesn't live up to its typesetting. This book is a huge exception to the trend and it's existence in the public domain is greatly appreciated.

### Software Engineering

[The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/)

Many people (wisely) have suggested that one stays away from comedy in their professional life. I did find the style of this endearing but even if I hadn't the quality of advise was also excellent. In the end, it's a truth universally acknowledged that _"Complexity very very bad"_. The post also points to [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design) at the end which I'm currently reading and enjoying.

[Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230)

One of many good recommendations from the Pragmatic Engineering Newsletter ([link](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/)) this really helped me to understand what I did (and didn't) like about the prospect of working in engineering (rather than data).

### Productivity, Career & 'just for fun'

[Maker's Schedule Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

I've read that this is a bit of a classic. It turned up at a moment I needed it and I tend to revisit it about once a quarter.

[Making it in Indie Games: Starter Guide](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/44181247500/making-it-in-indie-games-starter-guide) & [Spelunky by Derek Yu](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/spelunky-by-derek-yu)

Derek Yu knows how to get stuff done. I want to get stuff done. Sometimes the reason you like things is just that simple.

[Before We Go Live](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Before-We-Live-Navigating-Entertainment/dp/1739285905), [How I think about strategy games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76ugXvigqLE&list=PLesIE_v8rF219O7UaVnFZY8l4AxzlbbWU&index=85) & other works of jorbs

jorbs is a video game streamer who also really likes Bayesian Statistics. I discovered that a far wider range of people play Slay the Spire (the game jorbs is most commonly associated with) at a work dinner one year and so now I'm a bit more willing to point myself out as a fan. His book is also very good, although it comes with a range of content warnings and is pretty tough to read in places.
